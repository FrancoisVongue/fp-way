# Layered architecture of functions
    
2. Order of layers
    0. basic fp functions
    1. boolean
    2. numbers
    3. arrays
    4. strings
    5. functions
    6. objects
    
    Each type has functions that ... it
        1. translate (from other types, includes `creation`)
        3. validate (conditions)
        4. transform (to the same type but different properties)
