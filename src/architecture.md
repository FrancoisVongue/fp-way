# Layered architecture of functions
1. Basic fp functions
    the most essential functions for functional programming.
    
2. functions that transform other functions
    allow you to transform a given functions into 
    different function, in most cases returns the same function
    but `behaves differently`
    
3. functions composition
    functions that allow you to combine `multiple functions` into 
    one single function.
    
4. Types 
    specific functions for different data types
    
    1. boolean
    2. numbers
    3. arrays
    4. strings
    5. objects
   
5. Utilitie
